# Decision tree for Azure compute services

Use the following flowchart to help choose a compute service for your Azure application.
 
![](../images/compute-decision-tree.svg)

The flowchart guides you through a set of key decision criteria to reach a recommendation. Every application has unique requirements, so you should treat the recommendation as a starting point. Then perform a more detailed analysis, looking at aspects such as:
 
- Feature set
- [Service limits](/azure/azure-subscription-service-limits)
- [Cost](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/)
- [SLA](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/)
- [Regional availability](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/)
- Developer ecosystem and team skills

If your application consists of multiple workloads, evaluate each workload separately. A complete solution may incorporate two or more compute services.
